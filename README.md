# Real-Time Satellite Tracker

## Project Description
This is a long-term aerospace reconnaissance project that aims to provide real-time tracking and visualization of satellites using data from the N2YO API. The application displays satellite positions on an interactive map and provides detailed information about each satellite.

## Current Features
- Real-time tracking of satellites on an interactive map
- Satellite categorization and filtering
- Predictive trajectory paths for selected satellites
- Detailed satellite information display
- User-configurable satellite limit

## Work in Progress
- Implementing satellite search functionality
- Enhancing user interface for better data presentation
- Optimizing performance for handling larger datasets

## Future Goals
- Integration with additional data sources for more comprehensive satellite information
- Advanced filtering and analysis tools
- Mobile application development
- Historical data tracking and analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- Leaflet.js
- N2YO API
